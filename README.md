# Milestone 1
The goal of this milestone is to create an inverted index using the HTML files from the Algorithms and data structures developer zip.

## Required Analytics
- Retrieve the total number of indexed documents
- Get the number of unique tokens
- Get the total size(in KB) of our index on disk 


## Tasks Remaining
- Partial Indexes(When in-memory runs out)
- Serialization Error when writing index to file
- Iterate through all directories(Start with a few directories to test core functionality before expanding)
- Defragment URL
- Postings need to be sorted by document id
