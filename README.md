# Milestone 2
The goal of this milestone is to begin implementing the Search functionality. At the minimum, boolean queries of type AND needs to be implemented. tf-idf scoring is optional and no time constraints is needed

## Required Analytics
- For each provided query, retrieve the top 5 URLs
- Screenshot of search interface(For now it can be text but we can make it Web later)

## Tasks Remaining
- Implement Search Functionality(Deal with Boolean AND queries for now)
- Get 5 URLS for each of the given queries
- Fix memory issue for indexer
- Consider implementing tf-idf scoring system along with sorting using cosine similarity(Not required for M2)
- Add Weights/scoring features as needed to refine searching(Not required for M2)
- Write report once Search is working


# Milestone 1
The goal of this milestone is to create an inverted index using the HTML files from the Algorithms and data structures developer zip.

## Required Analytics
- Retrieve the total number of indexed documents - Completed
- Get the number of unique tokens - Completed
- Get the total size(in KB) of our index on disk - Completed


## Tasks Remaining
- Memory issue when loading and merging files(Save for Milestone2)
